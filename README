FlxExporter

ABOUT FLXEXPORTER

FlxExporter is a plugin for Tiled Map Editor that adds a new export
format for maps - ActionScript 3.0 source. It generates a class
that inherits from FlxGroup and can be used directly in
Flixel projects, without writing an importer.

FlxExporter is available only for the Qt version of Tiled Map Editor.

COMPILING

Put the plugin folder in %TILED%/plugins/src, where %TILED% is the
path to Tiled source.

Then modify %TILED%/plugins/src/plugins.pro and add FlxExporter to
subdirs:

    (e.g., subdirs=FlxExporter tmw)
	
Run qmake.

Now compile Tiled as usual and FlxExporter should be built with it.
